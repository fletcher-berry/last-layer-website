                This website is a compilation of last layer algorithms that I use or plan to learn and use in the future.  The main purpose
                of this website is to serve as a database of all One Look Last Layer algorithms. The algorithms on this website are grouped
                by OLL and OLLCP case, and this website contains algorithms specific to OLL and OLLCP for those who do not want to learn full
                1LLL.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am  in the process of generating all 1LLL algorithms.  Most algorithms on this site are generated by last layer king.
                However, I have taken many common subsets of algorithms from other websites and would like to give credit to these websites.
                The OLL algorithms on this website are algorithms that I currently use and most come from
                either <a href="http://algdb.net/puzzle/333">algdb.net</a> or <a href="http://cubewhiz.com/">cubewhiz.com</a>.
                Most of OLLCP, ELL, and ZBLL came from <a href="http://algdb.net/puzzle/333">algdb.net</a>.  Obviously, Algdb is a great resource
                for algorithms and has not only last layer algs, but also last slot algs, F2L algs, and 2x2 algs.
                Other significant contributions of algorithms come from <a href="https://jafboc.weebly.com/">Jon's website for bad OLLCP cases </a> and
                google docs from Cyotheking (Chris Olson), Rob Yau, and Jabari Nuruddin.  These docs are available
                at <a href="http://www.cyotheking.com/best-cubing-algs/"> Cyotheking's page of cubing resources</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have documented the sources of where I found most of the algorithms on this website and they can be viewed in the algorithm
                list so it is clear what algorithms came from what sources.  Also, by documenting my sources, I hope to give cubers other resources
                for finding algorithms because my algorithms might not be for everyone.
