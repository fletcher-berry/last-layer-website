Last layer algorithms for the Rubik's cube.
Work in progress.

## To run:
- Get MySql.data.core from Nuget.
- Set up database.  TODO: Add database schema and insert scripts.
- Eventually you will need to install whatever image library I use for generating images of cubes.  TODO: Figure out what that is.
