Last layer algorithms for the Rubik's cube.
Work in progress.

## To run:
- Install MySql.data.core from Nuget.

- Get CubingAlgs library and add as dependency.  This is from my CubingAlgs project on github.  TODO: include updated dll.  
- Set up database.  Run schema.sql and data.sql from the db scripts folder.  Change the connection string in appsettings.development.json to one for your database
